# Hello, world!!!

ðŸŽ® Hey there! I'm a beginner Game Developer.  
I enjoy creating worlds, mechanics, and ideas that come to life through code.  

Most of my projects (current & future) will be written in **C++**,  
since it's one of the main languages used in **Game Development** (especially with Unreal Engine ðŸš€).  

Iâ€™ll be posting experiments, small projects, and maybe even full games here.  
Stick around â€” thereâ€™s more to come! âœ¨
